# Multi-Objective-Optimization-using-Reinforcement-Learning-Method

Code about applying reinforcement learning method to multi-objective optimization.
The aim of this research is to obtain the optimal design combination by combinatorial optimization of nine different energy-related objectives.  
Note:
1. In the project, the relationship between design parameters and each objective value was fitted using MLP method and the model is stored in '.pth' file.
   Since this part is not directly related to MOO-RL, the corresponding weights are not put in the repository.
2. This project was developed based on this repository: https://github.com/lrlgogo/MORL.git, which is written using tensorflow. This project revised it in pytorch framework.
3. This project redefined the objective function suitable for the corresponding problem.
